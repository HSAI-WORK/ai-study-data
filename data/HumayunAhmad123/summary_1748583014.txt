### Food Preservation Methods Summary

#### **Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP)**
- **Purpose**: Preserve food by altering the storage environment to extend shelf life and maintain freshness.
- **Key Methods**:
  1. **Controlled Atmosphere Packaging (CAP)**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment of gas levels in storage facilities; used for long-term storage of fruits and vegetables.
  2. **Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP)**: Food is sealed in high gas-barrier packaging, air is removed, and the package is flushed with specific gases (e.g., CO₂, N₂, O₂).
  3. **Vacuum Packaging**: Air is removed from the package before sealing.
- **Objectives**:
  - Control or reduce the growth of undesirable microorganisms.
  - Retard enzymatic and respiratory activities in fresh foods.
  - Extend shelf life by inhibiting aerobic bacteria growth.
- **Key Gases**: CO₂ (20-100%) is commonly used to slow microbial growth by altering cell permeability, reducing pH, and interfering with enzymatic pathways.
- **Limitations**: Cannot control microbial growth solely by altering the redox potential (Eh); additional preservation methods are needed.

#### **Irradiation**
- **Purpose**: Use ionizing radiation to kill microorganisms, extend shelf life, and prevent sprouting in foods.
- **Types of Radiation**:
  - **β-rays**: Limited penetration power; ineffective for food preservation.
  - **X-rays**: Good penetration but inefficient for food applications.
  - **γ-rays**: High penetration power; preferred for food irradiation.
- **Common Sources**:
  - **Cobalt-60 (⁶⁰Co)**: Artificially induced radioactive isotope; widely used for food irradiation.
  - **Cesium-137 (¹³⁷Cs)**: Less commonly used due to lower availability.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Ionizing radiation strips electrons from atoms/molecules, creating ion pairs that inhibit microbial growth.
  - Does not make food radioactive.
- **Benefits**:
  - Destroys microorganisms, worms, insects, and larvae.
  - Prevents sprouting in foods like potatoes and onions.
  - Cold sterilization process; does not increase food temperature.
- **Limitations**:
  - Cannot destroy toxins or undesirable enzymes.
  - May cause lipid oxidation and protein denaturation at higher doses.
  - Consumer resistance due to misconceptions about radioactivity.
- **Safety**:
  - Extensively studied for over 40 years; deemed safe by WHO.
  - Approved in over 30 countries for meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, and grains.

#### **Key Takeaways**
- **MAP**: Effective for extending shelf life by controlling gas environments but requires supplementary preservation methods.
- **Irradiation**: Safe and effective for microbial control and shelf-life extension, though it faces consumer resistance due to misinformation.
