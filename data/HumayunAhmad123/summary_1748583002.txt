### Summary of Key Points:

#### Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) and Related Concepts:
1. **Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP):**
   - Reduces red-ox potential to preserve food.
   - Involves altering the storage environment to extend shelf life.
   - Uses high gas-barrier packaging, gas flushing, and sealing.
   - Combines vacuum packaging and gas-flush methods.

2. **Controlled Atmosphere Packaging (CAP):**
   - Requires continuous monitoring and adjustment of gas levels.
   - Expensive and used for long-term storage of fruits and vegetables.

3. **Vacuum Packaging:**
   - Removes air from the package and seals it hermetically.
   - Often considered a subset of MAP.

4. **Objectives of MAP:**
   - Control or reduce the growth of undesirable microorganisms.
   - Slow enzymatic and respiratory activity in fresh foods.
   - Extend shelf life by inhibiting aerobic bacteria.

5. **Challenges:**
   - Natural reducing components in food (e.g., proteins, ascorbic acid) can alter red-ox potential.
   - Additional preservation methods are needed for effective control.

#### Carbon Dioxide (CO2) in MAP:
1. **Role of CO2:**
   - Extends shelf life when used in high concentrations (20-100%).
   - Can be combined with nitrogen (N2) or oxygen (O2).

2. **Mechanisms of Action:**
   - Penetrates cells, altering permeability and reducing internal pH.
   - Interferes with enzymatic and biochemical pathways, slowing microbial growth.

#### Food Irradiation:
1. **Types of Radiation:**
   - **β-rays (electrons):** Low penetration, ineffective for food preservation.
   - **X-rays:** Poor efficiency, not suitable for food.
   - **γ-rays (photons):** High penetration, effective for food preservation.

2. **Common Sources:**
   - **Cobalt-60 (60Co):** Preferred for food irradiation due to availability.
   - **Cesium-137 (137Cs):** Less commonly used.

3. **Mechanism:**
   - Ionizes atoms and molecules, inhibiting microbial multiplication.
   - Prevents sprouting in foods like potatoes and onions.

4. **Safety and Applications:**
   - Does not make food radioactive.
   - Approved in over 30 countries for meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, and grains.
   - Extends shelf life without significant changes in flavor when exposure time and temperature are controlled.

5. **Limitations:**
   - Cannot destroy toxins or enzymes.
   - Can cause lipid oxidation and protein denaturation at higher doses.

6. **Consumer Perception:**
   - High resistance due to misconceptions about radioactivity.
   - Extensive research supports the safety of irradiated food.

#### General Principles of Ionizing Radiation:
1. **Mechanism:**
   - High-energy γ-rays ionize atoms, creating positive and negative ions.
   - Ionization disrupts biological systems, inhibiting microbial growth.

2. **Effects:**
   - Destroys insects, larvae, and prevents sprouting.
   - Does not increase food temperature, preserving quality.

3. **Challenges:**
   - Can cause oxidative damage to lipids and proteins at high doses.
