Here are five multiple-choice questions based on the provided content, designed to test comprehension of the key concepts:

---

### **Question 1:**
What is the primary difference between Controlled Atmosphere Packaging (CAP) and Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP)?  
A. CAP is used for short-term storage, while MAP is used for long-term storage.  
B. CAP involves continuous monitoring and adjustment of gas levels, while MAP does not.*  
C. CAP is less expensive to operate than MAP.  
D. CAP uses vacuum sealing, while MAP uses gas-flush packaging.  

**Explanation:** CAP requires continuous monitoring and adjustment of gas levels, making it more complex and expensive, while MAP involves sealing food in a gas-flushed package without ongoing control.

### **Question 2:**  
Which of the following gases is most commonly used in Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) to extend the shelf life of foods?  
A. Oxygen (O₂)  
B. Nitrogen (N₂)  
C. Carbon dioxide (CO₂)*  
D. Hydrogen (H₂)  

**Explanation:** CO₂ is commonly used in MAP because it inhibits microbial growth by altering cell permeability and reducing intracellular pH.

### **Question 3:**  
Why is γ-ray irradiation preferred over β-ray and X-ray irradiation for food preservation?  
A. γ-rays are less expensive to produce than β-rays and X-rays.  
B. γ-rays have higher penetration power and are more effective.*  
C. γ-rays do not produce any radiolytic products in food.  
D. γ-rays are more efficient at focusing on specific areas of food.  

**Explanation:** γ-rays are preferred because they have high penetration power, making them effective at killing microorganisms throughout the food.

### **Question 4:**  
Which of the following statements is true about food irradiation?  
A. Irradiated foods become radioactive and unsafe for consumption.  
B. Irradiation can destroy toxins and undesirable enzymes in food.  
C. Irradiation is a cold sterilization process that does not increase food temperature.*  
D. Irradiation is not approved for use in any country due to safety concerns.  

**Explanation:** Irradiation is a cold sterilization process that does not increase food temperature, making it different from heat-based preservation methods.  

---

### **Question 5:**  
What is the primary reason for consumer resistance to irradiated foods?  
A. Irradiated foods have a significantly altered taste and texture.  
B. Consumers believe irradiated foods are radioactive and unsafe.*  
C. Irradiated foods are more expensive than non-irradiated foods.  
D. Irradiation destroys essential nutrients in food.  

**Explanation:** Consumer resistance is mainly due to a lack of understanding that irradiated foods are not radioactive and are safe for consumption.
