### **Food Preservation Methods Summary**

#### **Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP)**
- **Purpose**: Preserve food by altering the storage environment to extend shelf life and maintain freshness.
- **Key Methods**:
  - **Controlled Atmosphere Packaging (CAP)**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment of gas levels; used for long-term storage of fruits and vegetables.
  - **Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP)**: Food is sealed in gas-barrier packaging with specific gases (e.g., CO₂, N₂, O₂) to inhibit microbial growth and slow enzymatic activity.
  - **Vacuum Packaging**: Air is removed from the package before sealing, reducing aerobic microbial growth.
- **Benefits**:
  - Extends shelf life by controlling aerobic bacteria and slowing enzymatic activity.
  - High CO₂ concentrations inhibit microbial growth by altering cell permeability and pH.
- **Limitations**: Cannot fully control microbial growth; additional preservation methods are often needed.

#### **Irradiation**
- **Purpose**: Use ionizing radiation (γ-rays, X-rays, β-rays) to kill microorganisms and extend shelf life.
- **Key Points**:
  - **γ-rays**: Most effective for food preservation due to high penetration power; commonly sourced from Cobalt-60 (⁶⁰Co).
  - **Safety**: Foods do not become radioactive; radiolytic products are minimal and similar to those in heated foods.
  - **Applications**: Extends shelf life, kills insects/larvae, and prevents sprouting (e.g., potatoes, onions).
  - **Limitations**: Cannot destroy toxins or enzymes; may cause lipid oxidation and protein denaturation at high doses.
- **Approval**: Recognized as safe by WHO and used in over 30 countries, but faces consumer resistance due to misconceptions.

#### **Key Takeaways**
- **MAP**: Effective for controlling microbial growth and extending shelf life, especially for fresh and ready-to-eat foods.
- **Irradiation**: A safe, non-thermal method for microbial control and shelf-life extension, though it has limitations and public perception challenges.
